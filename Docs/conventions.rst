Naming Conventions

FIMS Naming Conventions
-----------------------

You must divide your specimen spreadsheets and datasets up by plate or batch of samples that will be processed together in the laboratory pipeline.

Create your plate/batch name from [Institution Code]_[User Initials]_[Sequential Number]
	Example: CBOL_MGT_001 for the first plate/batch from Michael G Trizna of CBOL

This name will then be used for the:

* Spreadsheet filename (CBOL_MGT_001.xlsx)

* Dataset Code in FIMS

.. image:: /images/dataset_code.png
	:align: center

* extractionPlateID field in spreadsheet

.. image:: /images/plateid.png
	:align: center
	
* and will also be incorporated in the plate names in the LIMS system (see below)

LIMS Naming Conventions
-----------------------

Extraction Plate:
	*[dataset code]_X[extraction attempt number]*

	Example: CBOL_MGT_001_X01 for the first extraction plate from the plate/batch of samples in the dataset named “CBOL_MGT_001”. If you were to re-extract DNA from all of the samples in CBOL_MGT_001, then this second extraction plate would be called CBOL_MGT_001_X02.


PCR Plate:
	*[dataset code]_PCR[PCR attempt number]_[fwd primer]_[rev primer]*

	Example: CBOL_MGT_001_PCR01_dgLCO1490_dgHCO2198 for a PCR reaction of the CBOL_MGT_001 plate using primers dgLCO1490 and dgHCO2198. Subsequent PCRs should be named in chronological order regardless of the primer set used. For example if a second PCR was completed for this plate it would be named CBOL_MGT_001_PCR02_Fprimername_Rprimername.


Cycle Sequencing Plate:
	*[dataset code]_Seq[Sequencing attempt number]_[primer used]_[F or R]*

	Examples: CBOL_MGT_001_Seq01_dgLCO1490_F for the cycle sequencing plate for the forward strand using the dgLC01490 primer; and CBOL_MGT_001_Seq02_dgHCO2198_R for the reverse strand using the dgHCO2198 primer. 
	
*Important* There are different scenarios for dealing with re-runs (extractions, PCRs and sequencing) of subsets of each dataset. Please contact us to discuss these scenarios to ensure that you continue to use a manageable workflow in the LIMS.
